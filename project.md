# NovelForge

## Project Overview

NovelForge is a long-form novel writing system built around LLMs, memory management, workflow automation, and future multi-agent collaboration.

The primary goal is not to create a chatbot, but to build a persistent writing workspace capable of supporting long-term novel creation, especially fan fiction and web novels.

The project is designed as a learning platform for:

* LLM Application Development
* Agent Systems
* Workflow Design
* Memory Management
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Long-Context Story Generation

# Design Philosophy

NovelForge follows several principles:

1. Persistence before intelligence

A system that remembers is more useful than a system that only generates.

2. Workflow before agents

Stable workflows should be built before introducing multiple agents.

3. Skills before autonomy

Reusable skills are preferred over unconstrained agent behavior.

4. Project-oriented architecture

All writing should belong to a project with persistent files.

5. Model independence

The project should support switching between DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, Qwen, and other models with minimal code changes.

# File Responsibilities

## app.py

Streamlit user interface.

Responsibilities:

* Project selection
* User interaction
* Displaying outputs
* Calling skills
* Managing UI state

UI features:

* Memory editing via structured form (title, genre, world, characters, etc.)
  with raw JSON fallback in collapsible section
* Word count configuration per chapter
* Pipeline page shows per-step success/error status with partial results
* One-click memory compaction button

Business logic should remain minimal.

---

## llm.py

Model abstraction layer.

Responsibilities:

* Model connection
* API configuration
* Model switching
* API key validation
* Support for temperature and system message per call

Current model:

* DeepSeek Chat

Current configuration:

* `LLM_API_KEY` or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
* `LLM_BASE_URL` (optional)
* `LLM_MODEL` (optional)

Interface:

`call_llm(prompt, system_message="", temperature=0.7)`

* `system_message` — optional system role instruction
* `temperature` — per-call temperature control (default 0.7)

Future models:

* GPT
* Claude
* Qwen
* Local LLMs

Only this file should need modification when switching models.

---

## memory.py

Persistence layer.

Responsibilities:

* Project creation
* Loading memory
* Saving memory
* Loading outlines
* Saving outlines
* Loading chapter outlines
* Saving chapter outlines
* Loading chapters
* Saving chapters
* Loading reviews
* Saving reviews
* Fetching recent chapter summaries (configurable limit, default 5)
* Counting total written chapters

No LLM logic should exist here.

---

## prompts.py

Prompt template layer.

Responsibilities:

* Outline generation prompts
* Chapter outline prompts
* Chapter writing prompts (supports configurable word count)
* Chapter review prompts
* Memory update prompts
* Memory compaction prompts

Current prompt design notes:

* Chapter review prompt requests strict JSON for later workflow automation
* Memory update prompt requests strict JSON for safer persistence
* Chapter writing prompt accepts `word_count` parameter (default 2500-3500)
* Memory compaction prompt compresses old character/world/timeline/foreshadowing entries to control prompt length

Prompt engineering should be isolated here.

---

## skills.py

Skill execution layer.

Responsibilities:

* Generate outline
* Generate chapter outline
* Write chapter (with configurable word count)
* Review chapter
* Update memory
* Compact memory (compress old entries to control prompt length)
* Consistency check
* Character analysis
* Timeline analysis
* Foreshadowing analysis

Current skill design notes:

* Review results are normalized into structured status and saved as Markdown reports
* Memory updates are validated before being written into project storage
* All LLM-calling functions check for empty responses and raise explicit errors
* `pipeline_plan_write_review_update` executes steps independently — if one fails,
  remaining steps are skipped and partial results are still returned

# Project Storage Structure

Each novel project owns its own directory.

Example:

data/projects/fanfic_project/

Files:

memory.json

Stores:

* characters
* world settings
* timeline
* foreshadowing
* chapter summaries

outline.md

Stores the global story outline.

chapter_outlines/

Stores chapter plans.

chapters/

Stores chapter content.

reviews/

Stores review results.

---

# Memory Structure

Current memory schema:

{
"title": "",
"genre": "",
"world": [],
"characters": [],
"timeline": [],
"foreshadowing": [],
"chapter_summaries": []
}

Future versions may introduce:

* locations
* organizations
* power systems
* relationship graphs

# Future Roadmap

## Near-Term Design Improvements

The following design improvements are the most valuable next steps for the current architecture:

1. Stronger chapter planning context

Chapter planning currently combines global outline, memory, and recent chapter summaries — this is already implemented and working.

2. Structured review outputs

Chapter reviews now output structured status fields (pass/revise/blocked) in both Markdown and JSON format. The UI displays status metrics and issue/strength counts.

3. Safer memory updates

Memory update logic validates LLM JSON output strictly and rejects malformed updates. Validation covers field types and array element types.

4. Pipeline automation

The UI now supports a one-click pipeline (Plan → Write → Review → Update Memory) with per-step error isolation. If a step fails, partial results from earlier steps are preserved and displayed.

5. Better model abstraction

The LLM layer remains OpenAI-compatible while supporting configuration-based switching. Per-call temperature and system message are now available.

# Development Rules

1. Do not place complex business logic inside app.py

2. New writing abilities should be added as Skills

3. New prompts belong in prompts.py

4. New persistence logic belongs in memory.py

5. Model changes should happen only in llm.py

6. All generated content should be persistable

7. Maintain backward compatibility with existing project data

8. Chapter planning should use both long-term context and recent progress when available

9. Memory updates should fail closed when structured output validation fails

10. Review results should remain machine-readable before being formatted for human reading

---

# Instructions For Future LLMs

Before modifying the project:

Read files in the following order:

1. project.md

2. app.py

3. skills.py

4. memory.py

5. prompts.py

6. llm.py

When implementing new features:

* Reuse existing architecture
* Avoid breaking storage format
* Keep responsibilities separated
* Preserve project persistence
* Prefer adding Skills over hardcoding logic

This project is intended to evolve into a long-form novel writing platform and an educational Agent Systems project.
